## Activity Selection Problems
1. Sort Array / Activities
2. Perform first activity from the sorted list of Activities
3. Set : current_activity = first_activity
4. set : end_time = end_time_of_current_activity
5. go to next Activity if exist; if not exist terminate.
if start_time of current_activity <= end_time; then perform the Activity else goto step 4
